Thoughts on each line:

01: #include <stdio.h>
	Where is this found?
	Is it really injected right here?
	How does it keep the line numbers straight?

03: /* This is a comment */
	Simple multi-line comment.
	You can't nest these, but some people do funny things with them.

04: int main(int argc, char *argv[])
	Function decleration (and soon initialization).
	Type, name, arglist.  Pretty standard, maybe confusing because output type is on the left, and input types and names are on the right.

05: {
	Start of a block.  I think that blocks are required for functions, but not for everything that uses blocks.  Go figure.

06: int distance = 100;
	Hey, at least it's consistant.  Type, name, value;
	Initialization could be elsewhere.
	Lexical scope applies.

08: // this is also a comment
	Why have one type of comment when you can have two?

09: printf("You are %d miles away.\n", distance);
	Magic! Allows for 1 or more args.
	It can't/doesn't check for types which can lead to mahem.
	Sorta annoying that there's no built in println.  Oh well.

11: return 0;
	0 means okay!  Unix is strange that 0 is usually false.  Guess it's returning that errors=false.  But why return errors in the same path as data?

12: }
	Duh.
